# 0x02-functions_nested_loops
This project deals with functions in C. A Function is a block of code which performs a specific task. While function prototype is one that tells the compiler the function return_type, function name, several parameters it accepts, and the data types of the parameters to avoid error during compilation.

This project is part of my probation month project in ALX SE program created on Wednesday 24th May, 2023 during my undergraduate days in university.

Things worth noting in C functions:

int name(char alpha, int num);

1. it must have a return type i.e int
2. It must have a name i.e. name
3. It must include parameter type and name i.e. (char alpha, int num)
4. It return type or parameter can be void i.e. void name(void)
