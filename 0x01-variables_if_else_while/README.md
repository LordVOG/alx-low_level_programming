## Question
1. This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.
2. Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
3. Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
4. Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
5. Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
6. Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
7. Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
8. Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
9. Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
10. Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
<br>
Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space<br>
The two digits must be different<br>
01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1<br>
Print only the smallest combination of two digits<br>
Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits<br>
You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)<br>
You can only use putchar five times maximum in your code<br>
You are not allowed to use any variable of type char<br>
All your code should be in the main function<br>
11. Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.
<br>
Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space<br>
The three digits must be different<br>
012, 120, 102, 021, 201, 210 are considered the same combination of the three digits 0, 1 and 2<br>
Print only the smallest combination of three digits<br>
Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with three digits<br>
You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)<br>
You can only use putchar six times maximum in your code<br>
You are not allowed to use any variable of type char<br>
All your code should be in the main function<br>
12. Write a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.
<br>
The numbers should range from 0 to 99<br>
The two numbers should be separated by a space<br>
All numbers should be printed with two digits. 1 should be printed as 01<br>
The combination of numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space<br>
The combinations of numbers should be printed in ascending order<br>
00 01 and 01 00 are considered as the same combination of the numbers 0 and 1<br>
You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)<br>
You can only use putchar eight times maximum in your code<br>
You are not allowed to use any variable of type char<br>
All your code should be in the main function<br>
