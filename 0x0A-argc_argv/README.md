# 0x0A-argc_argv

This project is my first project after probation month passing with 95% score grade. Created on 12th June, 2023. <br><br>
argc - stands for argument count, this command is C main function parameter that counts the number of arguments passed to the program in the command line. e.g. gcc main.c -o test the total argument count here is 4. <br>
argv - stands for argument vector, is the pointer to array to char of the arguments passed to the program at CLI. It simply means the array of arguments passed into the program. e.g. gcc -o are array passed. <br><br>
